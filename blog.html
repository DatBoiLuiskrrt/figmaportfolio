    <h2>Learn React Router with a simple application</h2>
    <h3>What is React Router</h3>
    <p>
      React Router is by far one of the greates features of React. If you are a
      React dev, then you are expected to one day use React Router. When
      browsing a website, it is essential for the client to be able to view
      different pages seamlessly, or to navigate from one page to another. React
      Router is the library that makes this possible.
    </p>
    <h3>What is Routing</h3>
    <p>
      Routing enables the client to navigate from one view to another in a web
      application based on an action or request.
    </p>
    <h3>What is React Router DOM</h3>
    <p>
      The React Router DOM is the node module that is specific to routing in web
      applications as opposed to mobile.
    </p>
    <p>It allows us web developers to create routes for a React SPA</p>
    <h3>BrowserRouter, Route, Switch and Link</h3>
    <p>
      The BrowserRouter, Route, Switch and Link are all components of the
      React-Router. These components are divided into three categories.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        BrowserRouter: BrowserRouter is a router impolementation that has the
        ability to incorporate routing in react. BrowserRouter uses the HTML5
        Histoy API which includes pushState, replaceState and the popState event
        to keep our user interface in sync with the URL. BrowserRouter is the
        parent component that is used to store all other components and it uses
        regular URL paths.
      </li>
      <li>
        Route: Route is the conditional component that renders a component based
        on the URL defined or the URL it is pointing to. In other words, it is a
        component that renders your component when its path matches the current
        url
      </li>
      <li>Link:</li>
    </ul>
